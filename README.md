# memsafe_graph
Final project for MemSafety class, HMC Fall 2016. Implements a graph datatype in Rust and several well-known algorithms.

An analysis of the [`petgraph`](https://docs.rs/petgraph/0.4.1/petgraph/graph/struct.Graph.html)
API can be found in the file petgraph_review.md.

The API of my graph can be found in src/lib.rs.

A description of the planned algorithms can be found in algorithm_description.md.
